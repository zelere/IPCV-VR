# IPCV-VR: Augmented & Virtual Reality Coursework

> _A Unity-based coursework repository for the “Augmented and Virtual Reality” class, featuring evolving extensions of the Roll-a-Ball game._

---

## 🎮 Overview

**IPCV-VR** is a Unity project developed for the Augmented and Virtual Reality class. The core of this repo is the classic “Roll-a-Ball” game, which is extended in each class session with new features, mechanics, and VR/AR integrations.

This repository serves both as a learning platform and a showcase for progressive enhancements in immersive technology, using Unity’s powerful engine.

## 🏆 Coursework Goals

- Learn and apply AR/VR concepts in Unity
- Extend and customize the Roll-a-Ball game weekly
- Integrate new interaction paradigms (VR controllers, Leap Motion, AR overlays)
- Document progress for each class session
- Assess and compare user experience with different control schemes

---

## ✨ Features

- **Base Roll-a-Ball Game:** Classic marble rolling mechanics in 3D
- **Leap Motion Control:** Move the ball using hand gestures for immersive, hands-free gameplay
- **Keyboard Control:** Traditional keyboard input for comparison and accessibility
- **Experimental Control Assessment:** Ongoing experiments to evaluate and compare Leap Motion vs. keyboard controls (see `/docs` or results folder)
- **Weekly Extensions:** New scripts, objects, shaders, and gameplay added each week

---

## 🧪 Current Experiments

We are currently investigating the usability and effectiveness of Leap Motion hand tracking versus traditional keyboard controls for the Roll-a-Ball game. Data is being collected and analyzed to assess performance, user preference, and engagement.
