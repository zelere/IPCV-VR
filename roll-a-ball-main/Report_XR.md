Write in your report one or two paragraphs describing your problem statement. Specifically, write the (simple) research question you aim to answer with your study, describe the independent variables you will be controling, the dependent variables you will be measuring. Discuss possible parasite variables and how you would control them. Finally, specify you hypothesis based on your variables.

## Problem Statement

The aim of this study is to investigate which interaction method provides better user performance in a 3D object collection task within a virtual environment. Our research question is: **"How does the interaction method (keyboard control vs. Leap Motion hand tracking) affect user performance when collecting objects in the Roll-A-Ball game?"**

### Independent Variables

The independent variable in this experiment is the **interaction method**, which will be controlled by implementing two distinct input modalities: traditional keyboard-based WASD/arrow controls and Leap Motion hand gesture tracking. The dependent variables we will measure include **completion time** (time taken to collect all 12 objects), **accuracy** (number of successful object collections vs. missed attempts), and **user satisfaction** (subjective rating on ease of use and comfort). 

### Parasite Variables

Potential parasite variables that could affect results include participants' prior gaming experience, familiarity with either input method, hand dominance for gesture-based interaction, and learning effects from repeated trials. To control these variables, we will randomize the order of interaction methods between participants, provide standardized training sessions for each input method, record participant demographics and experience levels, and use counterbalancing to minimize order effects.

Based on existing literature on natural user interfaces, we hypothesize that *Leap Motion hand tracking will result in higher user satisfaction scores due to its intuitive nature, but keyboard controls will demonstrate superior performance in terms of completion time and accuracy due to the precision and familiarity of traditional input methods*.
